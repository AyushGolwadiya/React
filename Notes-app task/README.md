## üéØ Design Decisions

### Storage Strategy
- **Why localStorage?** 
  - Simple and built-in browser storage solution
  - No backend required for this small application
  - Persists data across page refreshes
  - Key naming: Using "notes-app" as the storage key for clear identification

### Component Structure
- **Why this component hierarchy?**
  - `App.tsx`: Main layout and routing
  - `AddNote.tsx`: Form component for creating new notes
  - `NotesList.tsx`: Display component for viewing all notes
  - `Navigation.tsx`: Simple tab-based navigation

### State Management
- **Why useState + this submit handler?**
  - Simple form state management with controlled inputs
  - Clear data flow from form to storage
  - Immediate feedback with loading states
  - Error handling for storage operations

### Navigation
- **Why this nav approach?**
  - Simple tab-based navigation for two main views
  - Clear visual feedback for active route
  - Minimal and intuitive user experience
  - Fixed position for easy access

### Styling
- **Why Tailwind CSS?**
  - Rapid development with utility classes
  - Consistent design system
  - Responsive design out of the box
  - Dark theme for reduced eye strain
  - Modern, clean aesthetic with proper spacing and typography

### Error Handling
- **Why show spinner here?**
  - Prevents multiple submissions

  - Automatic dismissal with state updates
